The bathroom is consistently out of soap; the toilet has a nasty \"ring\" in the bowl, as if it hasn't been scrubbed in years, and the floor does not appear to have EVER been mopped! The mirrors are smeared with fingerprints and have \"pock marks\"/damage. The \"marley\" covering the floor is puckering and the tape that binds it together is frayed, creating trip hazards. The space in general is WAAY too small; I don't know who decided such a small space was adequate to accommodate the myriad of cultural/artistic needs of the Black community; it appears the space was built without any real thought as to our needs. Instead of a tiny meeting room and tiny dance studio, MUCH larger facilities are needed; in addition to a larger meeting space and dance studio, there should've been a performance hall and SEVERAL meeting rooms (some small, and at least one large one). It appears the powers that be approved the construction of this tiny, inadequate space so it can say they did \"something\" for the Black community. I have been to the Mexican-American Cultural Center and the Asian-American Cultural Center; BOTH have facilities which are FAR-LARGER and more accommodating than the tiny \"bone\" \"thrown\" to Austin Blackfolk. Why was it determined our facility deserved to be the TINIEST and LEAST-APPOINTED?",

It can't be the bustling Mexican-American Cultural Center it was envisioned to be if it's only open during standard business hours during the week when those who would most benefit from it are at work.    For live music, there isn't a large enough indoor open space to accommodate dance space and a stage area.

They're biased towards certain groups, and, even if you make a comment on something it's not accurate, they'll disregard it.\n\n2) I'm 100% Mexican and some of the things the MACC try to portray as Mexican are not accurate. That's one of the things that disenchanted me from the MACC. That, and the lack of support.
